This tool estimates carbon emissions from various transport modes by calculating:

- `Embodied Emissions`: CO₂ released from manufacturing vehicles, bikes, batteries, etc., spread over average lifetime distance.
- `Operational Emissions`: Tailpipe emissions, electricity use (e-bikes, electric cars), or food energy (walking, biking).
- `Food-based Emissions`: Calculated from estimated calories burned per km and diet-based CO₂ per kcal:
    - **Average Western Diet**: 2.5 kg CO₂ per 1000 kcal  
    - **Low-Carbon / Plant-Based Diet**: 1.2 kg CO₂ per 1000 kcal  

### Key Emissions Factors

| Mode                     | Emissions Basis |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Small Car**            | 0.44 kg CO₂/km (IPCC 2021, EURO 3) |
| **Electric Car**         | 0.24 kg CO₂/km (IPCC 2021) |
| **Bus (per passenger)**  | 0.12 kg CO₂/km (UK DEFRA average) |
| **Local Electric Train** | 0.009 kg CO₂/km (EU average rail) |
| **Walking**              | 80 kcal/km × diet emissions |
| **Biking (standard)**    | 50 kcal/km × diet + 0.02 embodied |
| **E-Bike**               | 20 kcal/km × diet + 0.05 embodied |
